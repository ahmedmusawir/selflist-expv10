  <strong>SELFLIST CONSTITUTION.</strong> SelflJST seeks to change the way the
  public buys, sells, and lists all things in a legal and socially responsible
  way. Our website is different in that we don’t go out of our way to keep you
  here. We provide embedded links to speed you along on your SelfLISTing
  journey. Because we are making a website that serves our users in a fair, fun,
  and transparent way, we do have a few easy rules to keep things running
  smoothly.
</p>
<br /><br />
<p>
  <strong>LICENSING.</strong> SelfLlST grants its user a limited nonexclusive
  right to use the SelfLIST website for the purpose of making categories and
  listing virtually anything that is legal and socially responsible. Users agree
  not to sell or license any part of the SelfLIST website or its content.
  SelfLIST may distribute, divulge, copy, display and make derivative works from
  any categories or listings that are placed on SelfLIST.
</p>
<br /><br />
<p>
  <strong>FEES.</strong> All fees charged by SelfLIST are non-refundable and are
  based on the number of listings days purchased by the lister. The listing days
  have no value except on the SelfLIST website. The cost for each listing day is
  $0.25 and may be increased or decreased depending on the number of listing
  days purchased. Each user is given 1,000 free listing days per account. 1
  listing day may only be used for one 24 hour listing. Once a listing is
  active, it cannot be modified. It can only expire or be delisted by the
  lister. After a listing expires, the lister can relist it by using their
  available listing days. Listing days will not be prorated or refunded for
  early delisting by the lister or by SelfLIST. SelfLIST may delist any category
  or listing for any reason. Fees will be charged to the lister through the
  lister’s Paypal® account or through a credit card associated with Paypal®.
